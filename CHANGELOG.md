# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format loosely
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) with
subsections BREAKING / Added / Changed / Fixed / Deprecated / Removed.

The plugin is pre-1.0 (`v0.1.x`); the CHANGELOG starts recording changes
introduced during Milestone D hardening and will be human-curated for
every post-v0.1 release.

## Unreleased

### BREAKING

- `auto_cmd._write_auto_run_audit` no longer accepts `dict` payloads.
  Callers must pass an `AutoRunAudit` instance. Rationale: strict
  schema enforcement per Milestone D hardening (MAGI pre-merge D iter 1
  Caspar finding). Migration: construct `AutoRunAudit(...)` from
  existing dict fields using `AutoRunAudit(**payload_dict)`. Field
  validation now raises `TypeError` on schema mismatch (previously
  silent dict-passthrough).

### Added

- `AutoRunAudit` dataclass in `auto_cmd.py` formalising the
  `.claude/auto-run.json` schema.
- `MAGIGateError` kw-only typed attrs: `accepted_conditions`,
  `rejected_conditions`, `verdict`, `iteration`.
- Python 3.9 version floor enforcement in `dependency_check`.
- Cargo shim version regex validation (clippy / fmt / nextest / audit).
- `NEXTEST_EXPERIMENTAL_LIBTEST_JSON` env gate in `rust_reporter` to
  refuse running under incompatible nextest output modes.
- `ctest_reporter` now raises a specific `ValidationError` on empty
  JUnit XML rather than returning an empty suite.
- Resume mid-exit-8 detection via `.claude/magi-conditions.md`
  presence; `resume` directs the user to `sbtdd close-phase` for each
  pending condition before re-running `sbtdd pre-merge`.
- Pre-merge exit 8 emits a user-facing stderr summary explaining what
  to do next, so the exit code is self-explanatory without reading the
  conditions file first.
- `auto-run.json` is now written atomically via tmp + `os.replace`;
  a process killed mid-write leaves the previous audit intact.
- `pre_merge._loop2` unlinks any stale
  `.claude/magi-conditions.md` from a previous exit-8 run on entry, so
  successful gates never leave the trap file behind.
- INV-24 / INV-29 / TOCTOU contract docstrings on the relevant
  functions in `auto_cmd`, `pre_merge_cmd`, and `init_cmd`.

### Changed

- `auto_cmd._write_auto_run_audit`: strict `AutoRunAudit` signature
  only; schema is validated before any byte hits disk.
- `MAGIGateError`: optional kw-only typed attrs added; backward
  compatible for legacy positional callers.
- `resume_cmd._assert_state_stable_between_reads`: softened to only
  raise on CONTENT divergence between the two reads. mtime-only
  divergence emits a stderr warning and continues -- Windows NTFS
  editor saves bump mtime without rewriting bytes, and the previous
  strict check trapped users unnecessarily.
- `_read_audit_tasks_completed` now logs to stderr when falling back
  to `0`, so silent best-effort recovery is still observable.
- Cargo shim version regex tightened to per-shim anchored patterns
  (`clippy`, `rustfmt`, `cargo-nextest-nextest`, `cargo-audit-audit`)
  instead of the loose `^\w+\s+\d+\.\d+` pattern.

(Milestones A-C changelog is implied from the git log; post-v0.1
releases will carry fully human-curated entries.)
